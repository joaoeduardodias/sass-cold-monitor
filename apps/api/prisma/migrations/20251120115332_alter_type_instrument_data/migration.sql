  Warnings:

  - The `generate_data` column on the `instrument_data` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `data` on the `instrument_data` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `edit_data` on the `instrument_data` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
